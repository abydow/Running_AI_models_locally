# Running_AI_models_locally
## Installed ollama with the command 
```
 curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

```

## Installed some models -

```
ollama run <model_name:model_size>

```

- gpt-oss:20b
- qwen3-vl:8b
- deepseek-r1:8b

sadly my pc only supports the deepseek model, the other two ran out of memory 

```
ollama rm <model_name:model_size>
```

later, I installed qwen2.5-coder:1.5b

it works fine 

still I need to find a openAI thinking model that works for me...
